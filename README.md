#### Java Recursion

###### A few simple recursive programs 

---

> ###### Palindrome.java
>
> Recursively checks if a given string is a palindrome
>
> 1. Run: _Java Palindrome_
> 2. Follow **cmd** instructions to provide the string to be checked 



> ###### Sierpinski.java
>
> Recursively draws a Sierpiski carpet with the desired level of complexity 
>
> 1. Run: _Java Sierpinski_
> 2. Follow **cmd** instruction to provide desired level of complexity 



> ###### Bubbles.java 
>
> Everybody loves bubbles! These contain money! 
> Consider a group of bubbles arranged in a grid-like fashion (see **board.txt**). 
> Given a specific starting bubble, the goal is to pop bubbles in order to (recursively) obtain the most amount of money based on the following rules: 
>
> 1. The starting bubble is popped 
> 2. Bubbles are popped as long as they are northeast (up 1 row and 1 column to the right) or northwest (up 1 row and 1 column to the left) from the current bubble
> 3. Cannot go out of bounds 
> 4. Once a bubble in the top row is popped, stop
> 5. Return the maximum amount of money possible to obtain given the starting bubble 
>
> How to use: 
>
> 1. Run: _Java Bubbles startRow startCol_
>
>    ​	Where startRow and startCol are the grid coordiates of the starting bubble
>
> 2. Check the output for correctness 
>
>    ​	The starting coordinates should be printed correctly 
>
>    ​	The value of the starting bubble should be printed correctly 
>
>    ​	The maximum obtainable sum should be printed correctly 	
>
